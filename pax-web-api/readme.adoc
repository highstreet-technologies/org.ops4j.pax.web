* provide some utilities used throughout PAX WEB (`org.ops4j.pax.web.utils` package)

== Resource management utilities

One of most important requirements in PAX WEB is to be able to scan through archives in search for web-related artifacts (like annotated classes, TLD descriptors or JSF configurations).

In order to do that we can use several OSGi core methods and even core Java methods. OSGi environment specifics have to be considered as well.

So it's important to divide the scanning into two levels:

Class Space::

In JavaSE environments, a _class space_ is usually equal to `$CLASSPATH` and the most fundamental method, which is `java.lang.ClassLoader.getResources()` works with these rules:

* possible hierarchy of classloaders (AppClassLoader, ExtClassLoader, BootClassPath) is taken into account
* getting `""` resource doesn't work with JARs on classpath - no URLs are returned for such resource. Only directory based classpath entries are considered
* for standard entries on app/ext/boot classpath, there's `meta-index` file used which is used (at least by OpenJDK) to pre-cache content of jars
* for jars, only entries explicitly added to jar/zip can be found! For example, if there's `java/lang/Object.class` resource in `rt.jar`, it doesn't mean we can get `java` (or `java/`) resource (zip entry). That's the reason why we don't get resource for `""` name. It depends on how jar/zip was created.
* the most used `URLClassLoader` uses `sun.misc.URLClassPath.findResources()` which delegates to either `sun.misc.URLClassPath.JarLoader` (which delegates to `java.util.jar.JarFile.getInputStream()`) or `sun.misc.URLClassPath.FileLoader` (which uses `java.io.FileInputStream`)

In OSGi, there's no single classpath and we have to think about getting resources starting from single bundle. Single bundle, when treated as _entry point_ to some _class space_, may have these additional elements:

* bundles wired using `Import-Package`
* bundles wired using `Require-Bundle`
* bundles wired using `Fragment-Host` (though OSGi wiring implementation should automatically treat attached fragments as _part_ of given bundle)
* additional bundles or jars available on classpath defined by `Bundle-ClassPath` manifest header.

Actual scanning for resources::

That's very important to know when to _reach_ to additional bundles/jars when, for example, installing WAR bundle and processing it by pax-web-extender-war. There's really lots of things to do including annotation scanning, resource finding, etc.

=== Standard JavaSE mechanisms

In simplest, JavaSE scenario the runtime environment has these features (usually):

* `$CLASSPATH` definiting roots to load classes and resources from
* an instance of `java.lang.ClassLoader` to use for class and resource loading

When running simple class, the class' ClassLoader is `sun.misc.Launcher.AppClassLoader` (OpenJDK). Its parent is `sun.misc.Launcher.ExtClassLoader` which in turn doesn't have a parent. There's also out-of-hierarchy `sun.misc.Launcher.BootClassPathHolder`.

`AppClassLoader` and `ExtClassLoader` extend `java.net.URLClassLoader`. `BootClassPathHolder` doesn't extend anything. However all 3 contain an instance of `sun.misc.URLClassPath`.

`sun.misc.URLClassPath` contains two tables:

* `sun.misc.URLClassPath.path` contains URLs
* `sun.misc.URLClassPath.loaders` contains the same number of `sun.misc.URLClassPath.Loader` instances

There are two built-in loaders. Both use _base_ URL, call `java.net.URL(base, path)` URL constructor and call `java.net.URL.openConnection()`:

* `sun.misc.URLClassPath.JarLoader` - uses `new URL("jar", "", -1, url + "!/", java.net.URLStreamHandlerFactory.createURLStreamHandler("jar"))` (handler is `sun.net.www.protocol.jar.Handler`)
* `sun.misc.URLClassPath.FileLoader` - uses `new File(base, path)`

When calling `java.lang.ClassLoader.getResources()`, eventually all loaders from all class loaders in the hierarchy are checked (top-bottom).

=== Spring Framework

For the completeness, here's how the above fundamental mechanisms are used inside Spring Framework. Spring allows to use resource expressions like `classpath*:/**/MANIFEST.MF` which means _find resources named `MANIFEST.MF` anywhere and at any depth on the class path_. The main method is `org.springframework.core.io.support.ResourcePatternResolver#getResources()` implemented as `org.springframework.core.io.support.PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver#getResources()`.

When using paths without `classpath*:` (less interesting in case of Pax Web), Spring:

* when the specification is pattern, calls `org.springframework.core.io.support.PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver#findPathMatchingResources()`
* when the specification is not a pattern, just returns single `ClassPathResource`, `FileUrlResource` or `UrlResource`.

When using paths with `classpath*:`, Spring:

* when the specification is pattern, calls `org.springframework.core.io.support.PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver#findPathMatchingResources()`
* when the specification is not a pattern, just calls `java.lang.ClassLoader.getResources()`. Additionally, if the resource is `""`, Spring explicitly calls `org.springframework.core.io.support.PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver#addAllClassLoaderJarRoots()` to collect all the roots from class path by checking
** `java.net.URLClassLoader.getURLs()` (if class loader is URL class loader)
** `-Djava.class.path`

`PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver.findPathMatchingResources()` gets resource roots for the base path from the pattern. This again calls `PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver#getResources()`, but this time without a pattern. Then for each of the roots found, resources are searched using methods different for files, jars and `vfs:`.

Summarizing, Spring splits the parameter to `ResourcePatternResolver#getResources()` to get _base_ and _subpattern_ (if it's a pattern) and then iterates over the roots from class path.

=== OSGi

As mentioned before, in OSGi, there's no 1st level concept of class path. There are bundles and their contexts. So the equivalent of `java.lang.ClassLoader.getResources()` is `org.osgi.framework.Bundle.getResources()` which roughly emphasizes that the _starting point_ isn't the _class path_, but single bundle.

Methods involving class loader (thus requiring a resolved bundle):

* `Enumeration<URL> org.osgi.framework.Bundle.getResources()`
* `Collection<String> org.osgi.framework.wiring.BundleWiring.listResources()`
* `URL org.osgi.framework.Bundle.getResource()`

Methods that don't involve class loader (they operate directly on the _entries_):

* `Enumeration<URL> org.osgi.framework.Bundle.findEntries()`
* `List<URL> org.osgi.framework.wiring.BundleWiring.findEntries()`
* `Enumeration<String> org.osgi.framework.Bundle.getEntryPaths()`
* `URL org.osgi.framework.Bundle.getEntry()`

Additionally, these methods may be called on a class loader returned for `BundleWiring`:

* `Enumeration<URL> java.lang.ClassLoader.getResources()`
* `URL java.lang.ClassLoader.getResource()`

.Summary of resource related methods involving class loaders
|===
|Method |Description |Implementation details

|`Bundle.getResources()`
a|
* if the package of retrieved resource is on `Import-Package` list, wired bundles are checked and current bundle is *not* checked.
* otherwise:
** bundles wired using `Require-Bundle` are checked
** _local resources_ are checked which are roots from `Bundle-ClassPath` (e.g., embedded jars) *and* attached fragments
** only if still none found, bundles for `DynamicImport-Package` are checked
a|
* Felix:
** `org.apache.felix.framework.BundleWiringImpl.findResourcesByDelegation()` - called for bundle that's provider of imported package or a provider of _require bundle_ wire.
** `org.apache.felix.framework.BundleRevisionImpl.getResourcesLocal()` that checks `org.apache.felix.framework.BundleRevisionImpl.m_contentPath`
** `org.apache.felix.framework.cache.ContentDirectoryContent` for `WEB-INF/classes` on `Bundle-ClassPath`
** `org.apache.felix.framework.cache.JarContent` for `WEB-INF/lib/*.jar` on `Bundle-ClassPath` or for attached fragments.
* Equinox:
** `org.eclipse.osgi.internal.loader.BundleLoader.findResources()`
** `org.eclipse.osgi.internal.loader.BundleLoader.importedSources`
** `org.eclipse.osgi.internal.loader.BundleLoader.requiredSources`
** `org.eclipse.osgi.internal.loader.classpath.ClasspathManager.findLocalResources()`
** `org.eclipse.osgi.internal.loader.classpath.ClasspathManager.entries` contains roots from `Bundle-ClassPath`
** `org.eclipse.osgi.internal.loader.classpath.ClasspathManager.fragments` contains attached fragments

|`ClassLoader.getResources()`
|Just as `Bundle.getResources()`
|Calls `org.apache.felix.framework.BundleWiringImpl.findResourcesByDelegation()` internally.

|`BundleWiring.listResources()`
a|
* the returned object is `Collection<String>` containing unique names
* the duplicates are rejected, so even if multiple resources could be available via fragments or `Bundle-ClassPath`, we can't access them
* the returned names can be used as parameter to `ClassLoader.getResource()`, but again - without knowing which actual resource will be returned if multiple are available
* wires from `osgi.wiring.package` and `osgi.wiring.bundle` namespaces are checked
* for `Import-Package` wires (`osgi.wiring.package` namespace), only imported packages are checked
* for `Require-Bundle` wires (`osgi.wiring.bundle` namespace), all exported packages from the target bundle are checked. Additionally if the required bundle requires other bundles with `visibility:="reexport"`, those bundles' exported packages are checked as well.
* local resources are considered - in imported, required and current bundle
a|
* Felix:
** `java.util.TreeSet` is used as result of `listResources()`
** `org.apache.felix.framework.BundleWiringImpl.listResourcesInternal()` is called for imported, required and current bundle. For non-current bundle only relevant packages are considered when looking for the resource. Local resources are searched in `org.apache.felix.framework.BundleRevisionImpl.m_contentPath` (entries from `Bundle-ClassPath` and attached fragments).

|`Bundle.getResource()`
|Works like `Bundle.getResources()`. First imports are checked, then local resources, finally (if still not found), dynamic imports.
a|
* Felix:
** `org.apache.felix.framework.BundleWiringImpl.findClassOrResourceByDelegation()`
** `org.apache.felix.framework.BundleRevisionImpl.m_contentPath`

|`ClassLoader.getResource()`
|Same as `Bundle.getResources()` - uses wiring to get resources
a|
* Felix:
** `org.apache.felix.framework.BundleWiringImpl.findClassOrResourceByDelegation()`
** `org.apache.felix.framework.BundleRevisionImpl.m_contentPath`
|===

.Summary of resource related methods that don't involve class loaders
|===
|Method |Description |Implementation details

|`Bundle.findEntries()`
a|
* For any bundle, its revision and attached fragments' revisions are checked
* For a bundle with `Bundle-ClassPath`, the entries are *not* checked only main bundle content (which, in case of WAR bundles, may not be on class path).
a|
* Felix:
** `org.apache.felix.framework.Felix.findBundleEntries()`
** `org.apache.felix.framework.EntryFilterEnumeration(rev, includeFragments = true, path, pattern, recurse, isURLValues = true)`

|`Bundle.getEntryPaths()`
|Same as `Bundle.findEntries()` but different (no recursion, no URLs, `"*"` pattern) args for underlying enumeration.
a|
* Felix:
** `org.apache.felix.framework.Felix.getBundleEntryPaths()`
** `org.apache.felix.framework.EntryFilterEnumeration(rev, includeFragments = false, path, "*", recurse = false, isURLValues = false)`

|`BundleWiring.findEntries()`
|Same as `Bundle.findEntries()`
a|
* Felix:
** `org.apache.felix.framework.Felix.findBundleEntries()`

|`Bundle.getEntry()`
|Checks only bundles main content. No contents from `Bundle-ClassPath` and *no attached fragments*.
a|
* Felix:
** `org.apache.felix.framework.BundleRevisionImpl.m_content` used. No fragments, no `Bundle-ClassPath`

=== (Geronimo) XBean

http://geronimo.apache.org/xbean/[Geronimo XBean] project provides some bundles with low-level utilities.

* `org.apache.xbean.osgi.bundle.util.BundleClassLoader` from `xbean-bundleutils` helps with `Bundle.getResource[s]()` when we want to get resources from wired bundles, when the provider doesn't export given package
* `org.apache.xbean.osgi.bundle.util.BundleResourceHelper` from `xbean-bundleutils` is used internally in `BundleClassLoader`
* `org.apache.xbean.osgi.bundle.util.BundleResourceFinder` from `xbean-bundleutils` scans `Bundle-ClassPath` and attached fragments
* `xbean-finder` contains utilities that use `xbean-bundleutils` to provide classes for finding different kinds of resources (e.g., classes assignable to some interface).

These helper bundles do not use _new_ BundleWiring API:

* `org.osgi.framework.wiring.BundleWiring.listResources()`
* `org.osgi.framework.wiring.BundleWiring.findEntries()`

=== Mapping to Servlet API

Let's try to summarize (but only `getResource[asStream]` and `getResourcePaths`):

|===
|`ServletContext` |CMPN Spec 128 |CMPN Spec 102+140 |Bundle Core API

a|`getResourcePaths(path)`

* offers _directory_ listing relative to context root, but also includes resources from `/WEB-INF/lib/*.jar!/META-INF/resources/`
* path _must_ start with `/`

a|

* "128.6.3 Resource Lookup"
** The `getResourcePaths` method must map to the `Bundle.getEntryPaths` method, its return type is a Set and can not handle multiples. However, the paths from the `getEntryPaths` method are relative while the methods of the `getResourcePaths` must be absolute.
** This is a bit different than for `ServletContextHelper.getResourcePaths()` which uses `Bundle.findEntries()`
** Also `Bundle.getEntryPaths` doesn't check fragments, while `Bundle.findEntries` checks them
** Also there's confusion in WAB specification, because `ServletContext.getResource[AsStream]` is mapped to `Bundle.findEntries()`, while `ServletContext.getResourcePaths()` is mapped to `Bundle.getEntryPaths()`

a|`getResourcePaths(path)`

* default `ServletContextHelper` calls `Bundle.findEntries()` (non-recursive) and adds `java.net.URL.getPath()` to returned set
* path _must_ start with `/`
* no such method in `HttpContext`

a|`Bundle.findEntries(path, ...)`

* if bundle is `INSTALLED`, `findEntries()` attempts resolution
* fragments are always checked
* URLs are returned instead of names

`Bundle.getEntryPaths()`

* No fragments are checked
* No classloaders involved
* names are returned

a|`getResource()`

* path _must_ start with `/`
* path is relative to WAR context root _or_ to any `/WEB-INF/lib/*.jar!/META-INF/resources/`
* doesn't prevent access to `/WEB-INF/*` resources and doesn't take security constraints into account

a|

* "128.3.5 Static Content"
** "Servlet Context resource access methods" must be used [...] based on the `findEntries` method (matching `ServletContextHelper` contract)
** `WEB-INF/` and other restricted paths must _not_ be returned
* "128.6.3 Resource Lookup"
** For a WAB, these resources must be found according to the `findEntries` method, this method includes fragments

a|`getResource(path)`

* default `ServletContextHelper` calls `Bundle.getEntry()`
* nothing mentioned about leading slash
* default `HttpContext` should call (as in Javadoc of `HttpService`) `Bundle.getResource()`, so something completely different than what Javadoc for `ServletContextHelper` says.

a|`Bundle.getEntry(path)`

* path _may_ start with `/`
* `/` means root of the bundle
* _always_ relative to root of the bundle
* while `findEntries()` checks the fragments, `getEntry()` doesn't do it!

`Bundle.getResource()`

* involves classloader
* if bundle is unresolved (even after attempted resolution) only local content is checked (including fragments) and all the locations from `Bundle-ClassPath`
* if bundle is resolved, OSGi resource loading is used (boot delegation, imported packages, local content, ...)

== OSGi CMPN R7 140 Http Whiteboard Specification

Since OSGi CMPN R6, Http Whiteboard is an official specification and Pax Web (which had whiteboard for many years) has to do some adjustments.

=== Standard

CMPN R7 Http Whiteboard Specification allows registration (as OSGi services) of the following services:

* 140.4 Registering Servlets: `javax.servlet.Servlet` services
* 140.5 Registering Servlet Filters:
** `javax.servlet.Filter` services
** `org.osgi.service.http.whiteboard.Preprocessor` services handled before security processing
* 140.6 Registering Resources: any objects with `osgi.http.whiteboard.resource.pattern` and `osgi.http.whiteboard.resource.prefix` service properties. Actual service is irrelevant
* 140.7 Registering Listeners: services with these subinterfaces of `java.util.EventListener`:
** `javax.servlet.ServletContextListener`
** `javax.servlet.ServletContextAttributeListener`
** `javax.servlet.ServletRequestListener`
** `javax.servlet.ServletRequestAttributeListener`
** `javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionListener`
** `javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionAttributeListener`
** `javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionIdListener`

When registering the above servives, all additional and required information should be specified as OSGi service properties and/or Java annotations on the services. Annotations where specified only in R7 Whiteboard specification. Version R6 specified only service registration properties.

=== Pax Web Extender Whiteboard

`pax-web-extender-whiteboard` bundle sets up various `org.osgi.util.tracker.ServiceTracker` trackers to monitor web-related services being registered. In addition to the services specified by OSGi CMPN Whiteboard specification, Pax Web additionally tracks objects with interfaces from `org.ops4j.pax.web.service.whiteboard` packages, where both the _web elements_ (like servlets) *and* the configuration (like servlet mapping) can be specified directly in the registered objects (like `org.ops4j.pax.web.service.whiteboard.ServletMapping`).

This may be called _explicit whiteboard approach_ (where registration parameters are passed in type-safe manner).

=== Context

Java Servlet API specification defines `javax.servlet.ServletContext` interface which roughly means a distinguished namespace (with _context path_) where servlets, filters and other _web elements_ may be specified.

OSGi CMPN Http Service specification defines `org.osgi.service.http.HttpContext` interface that should _influence_ the `javax.servlet.ServletContext` associated with the servlets (and resources) being registered.

OSGi CMPN Whiteboard specification defines `org.osgi.service.http.context.ServletContextHelper` interface that plays the same role as the above `HttpContext`, but which is dedicated for Whiteboard specification.
This `ServletContextHelper` is explicitly associated with _context path_ (using `osgi.http.whiteboard.context.path` service registration property) - unlike `HttpContext` which doesn't have a _context path_.

OSGi CMPN HTTP Service specification (102.2 Registering servlets) mentions:

[quote]
----
[...]. Thus, Servlet objects registered with the same HttpContext object must also share the same ServletContext object.
----

Without actually specifying what _the same_ means. `felix.http` implements `org.osgi.service.http.HttpService.createDefaultHttpContext()` by returning _new_ instance of `org.apache.felix.http.base.internal.service.DefaultHttpContext` on each call...

OSGi CMPN Whiteboard specification (140.10 Integration with Http Service contexts) says:

[quote]
----
A Http Whiteboard service which should be registered with a Http Context from the Http Service can achieve this by targeting a ServletContextHelper with the registration property osgi.http.whiteboard.context.httpservice. The value for this property is not further specified.
----

Which means that the `ServletContextHelper` should be registered with `osgi.http.whiteboard.context.httpservice` property (and any value) and the whiteboard element should _select_ such context.

[source]
----
@HttpWhiteboardContextSelect("(osgi.http.whiteboard.context.httpservice=*)")
----

This is a bit confusing and there's no way targeting particular `HttpContext` from whiteboard element. The problem is that `HttpContext` interface doesn't include any hint about its identity. Pax Web introduces `org.ops4j.pax.web.service.WebContainerContext` interface with `getContextId()` method.

With whiteboard approach, a _context_ (`ServletContextHelper`) is *always* referenced by name, which means it has to be registered prior to registration of actual web element (e.g., servlet). This means that _global_ attributes of the context (like _context path_) are specfied using service registration properties.

With `HttpService.registerServlet(..., HttpContext)`, the _context_ is always passed together with the web element being registered, so there's fundamental problem when trying to implement _shared_ contexts:

Extended `HttpContext` (in Pax Web `org.ops4j.pax.web.service.WebContainerContext`) with added identity and kind of _shared_ flag could potentially be shared between bundles (bundle-scoped `HttpService` services), but in theory two invocations of `HttpService.registerServlet(..., WebContainerContext)` could pass a context with same name, but different implementation of methods like `handleSecurity()`.

(this has changed!) To this end, special `ReferencedHttpContext` interface is provided. When using it in `HttpService.registerServlet()`, it is assumed that matching context was already created before.
